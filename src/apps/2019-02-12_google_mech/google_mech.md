# Additional skills
[Optional, but strongly encouraged] Is there additional information about your technical abilities that could help us match you to a project? e.g., Are you proficient in more than the two languages noted in the above questions? Have you received awards, built an exciting system or application, acted as a project lead in your coursework, made open source contributions or participated in major programming projects? If you have previously interned at Google, please tell us about your project. (2000 chars max

I am extremely interested and experienced in robotics/automation, rapid prototyping, and manufacturing.

At Georgia Tech, I work on developing the sensor array for a brachiating (swinging) robot. Our team's sensor provides feedback about the pose of the cable that the robot swings on. My work has focused on collecting data from various sensors, including SLAM LIDAR rangefinders, stereo vision cameras, and inertial measurement units and then processing the data using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Python. My work further includes transforming our data between robot and world reference frames and creating the classifiers to detect and identify the cable with openCV.

I have also lead a team in building a robot that competed in the Georgia Tech "Creative Design Decisions Competition". The team prioritized building quick, useful iterations -- a methodology similar to the concept of Agile Development in computer science -- in order to learn about and fix failures quickly. By taking advantage of CAD, laser cutters, and 3D printers, the team iterated through three major robot revisions in the same amount of time in which most teams only worked on one.

In the past, I also lead a team of six students in designing and manufacturing a three pound battlebot. The team extensively used CNC machining to create a novel weapon drum that was more reliable and powerful than the equivalent drum manufactured with conventional machining methods.

# Additional preferences
[Optional, but strongly encouraged] Is there anything else you would like us to know about your preferences? e.g., What kind of projects excite you? Do you have a favorite Google product or know of a specific Google team that might be a good fit for your interests? Is there an area/discipline that you really want to learn? (2000 chars max)

I am most interested in projects that have complex and tight constraints. In particular, I like to rise to the challenges of limited time and resources or to tackle a hard problem. For these reasons, I have worked on many projects in the initial/advanced development stage, though I would be excited to come to work to do anything that I would find challenging or teach me new skills.

I am particularly interested in learning and building my skills in manufacturing, automation, controls, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and testing/experimental methodology.
